### Pangenome Iterative Refinement And Threshold Evaluation (PIRATE)
PIRATE is a toolbox for identifying and exploring the pangenome of collection of bacterial genomes. Recent software packages, such as roary and LS-BSR, have allowed for users to construct pangenomes of ever greater numbers of bacterial genomes on easily accessible hardware over convenient timeframes. However, many of the current methodologies use set thresholds for amino acid or nucleotide diversity. They may therefore misidentify core or accessory genes that are sufficiently diverged than they are are not clustered together at the selected threshold. PIRATE extends the methodology developed for roary and applies it over a range of possible thresholds (amino acid or nucleotide diversity). Genes are clustered initially based upon their %identity and then separated into distinct clusters if, at any threshold, the dosage of the genes in all of the genomes in a cluster is equal to 1. The original cluster nomenclature is retained, allowing for the identification of related gene clusters.Furthermore, PIRATE classifies paralogous genes into either putative gene fission/fusion events or gene duplications/loss, providing a robust framework for studying these events within a collection of genomes.

## Installation and usage
Details on the methodology used by PIRATE, installation and usage information can be found at the [PIRATE wiki](https://github.com/SionBayliss/PIRATE/wiki). 

**Please note: PIRATE is in development and the wiki incomplete. Feedback and bug reports are more than welcome.**
